# React Query Demo

Demo application to show how to add tanstack query to a simple application to show off queries/mutations.

The `main` branch shows the state before any changes and the `react-query` branch shows how it could look after adding queries and mutations.

# Running

Tested using node 18.

Install dependencies with `npm install` / `pnpm install` then start application with `npm run dev` / `pnpm dev`.

Application should be available on localhost:5173
